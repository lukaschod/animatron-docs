<p>This package includes high performance, modular and scalable animation systems. It is developed with <a href="https://unity.com/dots">DOTS</a> in mind. As result, it takes advantage of Unity's latest technology stack like <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.mathematics@latest">SIMD mathematics</a>, <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.jobs@latest">Jobs</a>, <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@latest">Burst compiler</a>, <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest">EntityComponentSystem</a> and <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities.graphics@latest">EntityGraphics</a>. Additionally, there is hybrid mode support that enables using it with <code>GameObjects</code> in Object Oriented Programming.</p>
<p>This lightweight animation system is designed with performance and flexibility at its core. Built to be easily extendable, it provides a solid foundation for developers who want full control over their animation pipeline. The system is modular by design—only the features you need are active, ensuring minimal overhead and no wasted resources. Whether you're building something simple or highly customized, this package offers the freedom to tailor it to your specific needs without paying the cost of unused functionality.</p>
<p>This package is designed to work with both concepts DOD (Data oriented design) and OOP (Object oriented programming).
Both share the same authoring components.</p>
<h2 id="animatron-vs-animator">Animatron vs Animator</h2>
<p>Animatron mainly and most importantly delivers greater performance compared to unity animator. Animatron in particular cases can easily have 8x less cpu cost compared to animator. However is quite important to understand a lot of this performance gains comes from fact animatron is designed to have more targeted solutions instead of having one that attempts to solve everything. Here is the main restrictions of animatron that enables better optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animator stores animation data in curves and that can have not only transformation data, but high variaty of different options like light intensity and more. This usually comes as features of fbx format. As result animator needs tu resolve this curves at runtime and bind them to particular properties that adds substantial overhead. In most games this is not really needed and most of the times non transform properties are handled not through animations. For this reason animatron takes advantage of this restrictions and instead stores only transforms information.</li>
<li>In unity imported fbx bones structure is imported as game object. As result unity animator must continue levering them for transformations and as result it adds all the overhead that comes from game object and its tranform hierarchy. In animatron this is stored in simple array and transformations are minimized to bare minimum, thus avoiding a lot of overhead. Keep in mind that you can still access the bone transform at runtime for things like attachments.</li>
<li>In unity mesh deformation happens either in compute shader or cpu oppose to in vertex shader. Both solutions have they advantages and disadvantes. Mainly unity chose this solution for shader simplicity as that would require handling vertex skinning for each possible shader including custom user shaders. The other advantage of it in shaders with multiple passes can actually reduce gpu cost as you dont need to do it in each pass vertex pipeline stage. However this also has some serious disadvantages as each instance has to have custom mesh it cant use gpu optimization of instanced rendering that greatly reduces cpu cost. The other one skinning on cpu is extremely costly and skinning on compute shaders typically not very friendly on tiled based devices (etc. mobile). For this reason animatron uses vertex shader for skinning instead of using compute or cpu.</li>
